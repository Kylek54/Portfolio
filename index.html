                <p>I am Kyle Kohli, and I have spent the last 6 years delving deep into the techniques and applications
                    of web design. Being able to take a design and create it using a text document was not immediantly
                    something that I wanted to pursue, but I quickly began to love web design alongside my peers during
                    my education. Being a leader and helping those who need it has always been at the forefront of what
                    I do, and I plan to continue this practice into my career.
                    <br><br> With the many mentors I have had along the way, I am graduating with a bachelors of science
                    in Visual Communication Tenchology and I want to put my degree to use helping small businesses to
                    flourish, as well as create something meaningful that I can be proud of.</p>

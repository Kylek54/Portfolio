        <p>I am Kyle Kohli, and I have spent the last 6 years delving deep into the techniques and applications of web design. Being able to take a design and create it using a text document was not immediantly something that I wanted to pursue, but I quickly began to love web design alongside my peers during my education. Being a leader and helping those who need it has always been at the forefront of what I do, and I plan to continue this practice into my career. 
            <br><br> With the many mentors I have had along the way, I am graduating with a bachelors of science in Visual Communication Tenchology and I want to put my degree to use helping small businesses to flourish, as well as create something meaningful that I can be proud of.</p>

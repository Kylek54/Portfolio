            <h2>Ashe</h2>
            <p>Ashe quickly fires her rifle from the hip or uses her weaponâ€™s aim-down sights to line up a high damage shot at the cost of fire-rate. She blasts enemies by throwing dynamite, and her coach gun packs enough punch to put some distance between her and her foes. </p>

            <h2>Ana</h2>
            <p>Ana's versatile arsenal allows her to affect heroes all over the battlefield. Her Biotic Rifle rounds and Biotic Grenades heal allies and damage or impair enemies; her sidearm tranquilizes key targets, and Nano Boost gives one of her comrades a considerable increase in power.</p>
